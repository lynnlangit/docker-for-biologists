Application (tool or script) Virtualization

    Includes tool or script  
    Can include more than one tool or script  
    Includes configuration information  
    Can include init command or script  

How differs from Virtual Machine

    Smaller/more efficient - multiple Docker containers can run on one VM  
    Often the OS is not included (however OS tools may be included)  
    Can scale up/down faster in container clusters than VM clusters
