Show a running Terra/FC analysis workflow (pipeline)

Parts  
    1. WDL - define workflow to be run on Cromwell  
    2. Config(s) - tool specific config files  
    3. Docker files - tool (or script) virtualization  
    4. Data - public cloud buckets or mounted volumes  

When to use....

    1. Can't run on my laptop -- too complex and/or too much data
    2. Can't road on Broad cluster -- would have to wait too long
