Resources for using docker for biologists

1. Motivation - why (run experiments at scale, create repro research)
2. Understanding - what (application virtualization, compare to VMs)
3. Reuse - how (find, run, verify)
4. Build - how (compute[dependencies], files, configuration, initial state[command])
5. Test - how (locally)
6. Run - how (register[which registry] + determine orchestration[K8, cromwell...])
7. Deploy - how (target deployment environments - GCP, FC, Terra, DNANexus, others)
